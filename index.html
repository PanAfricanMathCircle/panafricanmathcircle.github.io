<h2 class="h-title">Our Mission</h2>
<span class="h-line"></span>

<p>
  The Pan-African Math Circle is a program promoting advanced math
  education across the African continent by running free online
  math lessons and contests, and building a community of talented
  African high school students.
</p>

<h2 class="h-title" id="lk-about">About Us</h2>
<span class="h-line"></span>

<p>
  The program works with talented students and local educators to
  bring free, biweekly online lessons and contests to the smartest and
  most dedicated students in Africa and beyond. The lessons will be
  held on Zoom over the Internet. We aim to start lessons in January
  2022, held twice a month on Saturday afternoons. We will have more
  exact dates and details shortly!
</p>

<p>
  We are a group of math and computer science PhD students and
  professors from top universities, including Stanford, MIT, Harvard,
  and Columbia, with passion and experience teaching students around
  the world.
</p>

<h4>Why Math in Africa?</h4>

<p>
  By studying mathematics beyond the school level, students open up
  doors to high paying, meaningful careers in science and technology,
  and gain critical thinking skills to thrive in a rapidly changing
  world.  Students who study math beyond the school level will have an
  advantage in college admissions, and perform better in any
  scientific field in college and beyond. Similar mathematical
  programs have produced some of the top engineers, scientists, and
  mathematicians in the United States and Europe, and weâ€™re trying to
  bring that to Africa.
</p>

<p>
  This program grew out of work by staff members on a math program in
  West Africa, which has successfully helped dozens of bright African
  students prepare for international math contests and gain admissions
  into top global universities like Stanford, MIT, Princeton, and
  Harvard. Top program participants went on to achieve top honors in
  Ivy League universities, and land high paying careers at Google and
  Facebook. This West African math program, on which the Pan-African
  Math Circle is based, has helped thousands of students excel in
  college and beyond.
